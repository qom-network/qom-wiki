## Introducing Decentralized Social Media CAW üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ  

**Project Overview**  
CAW (A Hunters Dream) is a cryptocurrency project focused on decentralization and the power of the community, based on the caw.is manifesto.
The manifesto aims to build a truly decentralized system with no single ruler, where users play a role in determining the direction of the project.
The application and token are currently available on the QL1 chain, and the beta version of the DApp has been released.

##### **CAW Portal Site:**

## CAW Features and Functions

### ‚öîÔ∏è 1. Censorship Resistant:

The protocol itself has no central authority, and the front end manages the content. The protocol is unregulated and eternal. The balance between ethics and freedom of speech lies in the management of the front end and the dissemination of the protocol.

### üíæ 2. Permanent data storage

Data is stored permanently on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and privacy.

### ü™ô 3. Role of the token

For each activity, users consume CAW tokens (e.g., sending a message costs 5,000 CAW). This suppresses bot activity, which is a problem in traditional social media, and contributes to maintaining a healthy platform.  
  
### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• 4. Multi-chain support  
It is possible to bridge tokens between QL1 and Ethereum, and it is expected to be used on different chains and in decentralized bridges in the future.  

## Current status of the QL1 CAW project  
The project is in the application testing phase, and is being adapted to the OL1 community's use and feedback as it moves towards a community-driven mainnet.  

## Social problems that CAW solves  
CAW (A Hunters Dream) is a cryptocurrency project that aims to be a decentralized social clearinghouse and solve the following social issues:  
  
Problems with centralization:  
Currently, social media is controlled by certain companies or organizations, and censorship and manipulation are often carried out. CAW will build a decentralized system without a single ruler, providing an environment in which users can act freely.  
  
Data Privacy:  
Centralized data storage poses the risk of personal information being leaked, but CAW uses blockchain technology to decentralize data and protect privacy.  
  
User sovereignty:  
On existing social media platforms, account ownership is under the control of the service provider, and there is always the risk of censorship.
CAW provides user-sovereign social media services by replacing accounts with personally owned NFTs and realizing decentralized identity.  
  
Transparency:  
While decision-making in a centralized system is opaque, CAW increases trust by making transactions public on the blockchain.  
  
*These issues are inferred from the CAW manifesto and community discussions, and some details of the project are still unclear.
We will update the community on this matter as development progresses.
